Microtissue Structure Toolbox
=============================

Tools to analyze and simulate cardiac microtissue structure.

Analysis code for "Single cell determination of engineered cardiac microtissue structure/function using light sheet microscopy"

This package provides the following tools:

* ``simulate_3d_aggregate_mixing.py``: Simulate randomly mixed 3D aggregates
* ``analyze_3d_aggregate_mixing.py``: Analyze empirical or simulated 3D mixing studies
* ``stats_3d_aggregate_mixing.py``: Fit distribution curves to simulated or empirical data

Details of each tool are described below.
